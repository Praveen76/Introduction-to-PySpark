# Introduction to PySpark

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that provides an introduction to using PySpark for machine learning. The notebook demonstrates how to explore and visualize datasets, and implement machine learning models using PySpark.

## Repository Contents

- `Introduction_to_PySpark.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook that covers the basics of PySpark, including setup, usage, and examples.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this experiment, you will be able to:

- Understand the concept of machine learning using PySpark
- Explore and visualize the California housing dataset
- Understand code implementation for performing machine learning using PySpark

## Getting Started

To get started with the notebook, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Apache Spark
- Necessary Python packages (listed in the `requirements.txt` file)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Introduction-to-PySpark.git
    cd Introduction-to-PySpark
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure Apache Spark is installed and properly configured on your system. You can download it from the [Apache Spark website](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html).

### Usage

    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    or

    ```sh
    jupyter lab
    ```

2. Open the notebook `Introduction_to_PySpark.ipynb`.

3. Follow the instructions and run the cells in the notebook to learn about and use PySpark for machine learning.
